    **MetrOstinato**, a Project by Henrike Legner and [Ophelia Flassig](https://opheliaflassig.de/metrostinato/), combines aesthetic moments in everyday live with a scenic performance at an established cultural location.

    It is a finalist in the HMTM's **XPLORE competition** for new concert formats. The selected students received a production budget of €3,000 to implement and perform their idea at a public final on 17 May 2024.

    In the first part, on **7 April**, baroque instruments and early music will be removed from their usual concert context and made tangible for the city population. At the U3 subway stations between Fürstenried West and Brudermühlstrasse, a historical Chaconne by Henry Purcell, The Fairy-Queen (1692), is being performed simultaneously and can be experienced as a musical safari as you drive past.

    In the second part, on **17 May**, the sound world of the subway (metro) will be reflected in sound and images and set in a musical dialogue in the concert hall of the Reaktorhalle (Luisenstraße 37a 80333 Munich) that connects past and present.
